If you are getting input not set up warnings in Unity as starting a new OVR project, you can use this file to overwrite the existing input file.

This will let you build and may work with the controller, but it may not work the way you want it to (just Fyi)

Overwrite the file with the same name in the ProjectSettings folder of the Unity Project folder.
